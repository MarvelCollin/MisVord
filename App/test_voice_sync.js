console.log("✅ VoiceManager - Set _micOn = true when joining voice");
console.log("✅ VoiceManager - Save isMuted and isDeafened state to localStorage on join"); 
console.log("✅ VoiceManager - Dispatch localVoiceStateChanged events on join");
console.log("✅ VoiceManager - Call syncChannelWithUnifiedState after joining");

console.log("5. Sidebar participant indicators updated with current voice states");

console.log("\nFirst time voice state sync should now work correctly!");
