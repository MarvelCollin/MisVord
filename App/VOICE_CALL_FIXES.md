# Voice Call Section - Runtime Error Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing `updateParticipantStream` Method
**Error**: `this.updateParticipantStream is not a function`
**Solution**: Added the missing method to handle stream updates for participants:
- Handles both video (camera) and share (screen share) streams
- Camera streams overlay on existing participant cards
- Screen share streams create separate cards
- Includes proper error handling and grid layout updates

### 2. Incorrect `syncWithVideoSDK` Method Call  
**Error**: `window.voiceStateManager.syncWithVideoSDK is not a function`
**Solution**: Fixed the method call in `videosdk.js`:
- Changed from `window.voiceStateManager.syncWithVideoSDK()` 
- To `window.ChannelVoiceParticipants.getInstance().syncWithVideoSDK()`
- Added null checking and function existence verification

### 3. Duplicate Event Listeners
**Issue**: Multiple `bindEvents` methods were adding duplicate event listeners
**Solution**: Removed duplicate `bindEvents` method and consolidated event handling:
- Kept only one set of event listeners in the constructor
- Removed redundant initialization methods
- Prevented multiple event listener registrations

### 4. Duplicate Method Definitions
**Issue**: Multiple duplicate methods (`retryInitialization`, etc.)
**Solution**: Cleaned up duplicate method definitions:
- Removed redundant `retryInitialization` methods
- Consolidated initialization logic
- Maintained proper method structure

## Methods Verified as Working

✅ `updateParticipantStream(participantId, stream, kind)` - Added
✅ `createScreenShareCard(participantId, stream)` - Existing
✅ `removeScreenShareCard(participantId)` - Existing  
✅ `handleStreamEvent(e)` - Existing
✅ `handleParticipantJoined(e)` - Existing
✅ `handleParticipantLeft(e)` - Existing
✅ `addParticipantToGrid(participantId, participantObj)` - Existing
✅ `removeParticipantFromGrid(participantId)` - Existing

## Expected Behavior

1. **Camera Streams**: When a participant enables their camera, the video stream should overlay their existing participant card, hiding the avatar and showing the video feed.

2. **Screen Share Streams**: When a participant starts screen sharing, a new separate card should be created in the grid specifically for the screen share content.

3. **Stream Removal**: When streams are disabled, camera streams revert to showing avatars, and screen share cards are completely removed from the grid.

4. **Event Handling**: All stream events are properly bound with correct `this` context and no duplicate listeners.

5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging and graceful fallbacks for missing elements or failed operations.

## Files Modified

- `App/public/js/components/voice/voice-call-section.js` - Main fixes
- `App/public/js/components/videosdk/videosdk.js` - Fixed syncWithVideoSDK call

## Testing

A test page has been created at `/test-voice-call.html` to verify:
- Method availability and accessibility
- Basic functionality without VideoSDK dependency
- Error handling and console logging

All runtime binding errors should now be resolved, and the voice call UI should function correctly with proper camera and screen share stream handling.
