# Tic-Tac-Toe Lobby System Implementation

## New Lobby System Overview
Implemented a **multi-player lobby system** where:
- **Lobby**: Can accommodate unlimited players waiting
- **Game**: Only first 2 ready players get to play  
- **Auto-start**: When 2 players are ready, they automatically start playing
- **Separation**: Game players are moved to separate game rooms
- **Continuation**: Remaining players stay in lobby for next game

## System Architecture

### 🏛️ **Lobby vs Game Room Structure**
```
┌─────────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────────┐
│     LOBBY ROOM      │    │     GAME ROOM        │
│  tic-tac-toe-       │    │  tic-tac-toe-game-   │
│  server-{id}        │    │  {id}-{timestamp}    │
│                     │    │                      │
│ • Unlimited players │    │ • Exactly 2 players │
│ • Waiting to play   │    │ • Active game        │
│ • Ready states      │    │ • Isolated gameplay  │
└─────────────────────┘    └──────────────────────┘
```

### 🔄 **Player Flow**
1. **Join Lobby** → Player enters waiting room
2. **Ready Up** → Player marks ready status  
3. **Auto-Match** → First 2 ready players paired
4. **Game Start** → Paired players moved to game room
5. **Game End** → Players can play again or return to lobby
6. **Lobby Continues** → Remaining players stay for next game

## Technical Implementation

### 🗂️ **Server-Side Changes (`activityHandler.js`)**

**New Data Tracking:**
```javascript
socket.data.ticTacToeInGame = true/false     // Track if player is in active game
socket.data.ticTacToeGameRoom = "room_name"  // Track specific game room
```

**Lobby Management:**
- Separate lobby players from game players
- Track ready states only for lobby players
- Auto-start when 2+ players ready

**Game Room Isolation:**
- Each game gets unique room: `tic-tac-toe-game-{server_id}-{timestamp}`
- Game moves only broadcast to game room participants
- Lobby remains independent

### 🖥️ **Client-Side Changes (`tic-tac-toe.js`)**

**Enhanced UI:**
```javascript
// Lobby status display
<div id="lobby-info" class="text-[#72767d] text-xs bg-[#2b2d31] px-3 py-2 rounded-lg">
    Players in lobby: 0
</div>
```

**Real-time Updates:**
- Live lobby count display
- Game start notifications  
- Player join/leave updates
- Game abandonment handling
