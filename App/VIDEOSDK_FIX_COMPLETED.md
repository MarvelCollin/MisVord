## 🧪 TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE

Created comprehensive testing tools:
- Web test interfaces at `/test-docker-videosdk.html`
- API endpoints for JSON testing
- CLI test scripts for validation
- Debug interfaces for troubleshooting

## 📋 CONFIGURATION VERIFIED

✅ docker-compose.yml - Environment variables properly mapped
✅ Dockerfile.php - IS_DOCKER=true flag set
✅ .env file - All VideoSDK credentials present
✅ Environment loader - Enhanced with Docker prioritization
✅ VideoSDK config - Direct Docker access implemented
✅ Voice section - Robust path resolution added

## 🎯 RESULT

The error "VideoSDK token must be set in environment variables (VIDEOSDK_TOKEN). Check your .env file." should no longer appear in the voice section when running in Docker.
